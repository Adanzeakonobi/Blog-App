post = Post.create(author: user1, title: 'Hello 3', text: "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum \
is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making \
it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, \
looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going \
through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum \
comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good \
and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular \
during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a \
line in section 1.10.32.
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. \
Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in \
their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.")
